## Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis with Looker Studio
#### (Data-Driven Insights & Business Recommendations)
As a Data Analyst, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Superstore Sales dataset (2014–2017) using Looker Studio as the primary tool for data visualization and storytelling.

The objective of this analysis was to uncover the key factors influencing profitability, focusing on product categories, regions, customer segments, and discount policies.

### Key Findings
1. **Consumer segment** contributes ~50% of sales, but **Corporate** is more profitable.

3. **High-sales sub-categories** (Phones, Chairs, Tables) don’t always generate high profit.

4. A significant portion of sales comes from **Medium & Low Profit segments**, with noticeable sales in **Loss category**.
